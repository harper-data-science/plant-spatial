## Spatial Data in R

-   Ch 01:
    -   Overview
    -   The datasets
-   Ch 02
    -   R tricks
    -   Problems

## Sensors and satellites

<center>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics("img/fig01.png")
```

</center>

## Sensors and satellites

<br>

-   Increase in sensors, increase in available data

-   Statistical methods and software

-   So-called `spatial data`

-   subtleties, but basically geolocated, x and y coordinates

-   CRS (Coordinate Reference System\[s\])

## Special problems in spatial data

<br>

Statistical properties

1)  Spatial data has a lot of data points, so `power` is large even for `tiny effect sizes`, thus the Null is always rejected (even if practically meaningless)

2)  Spatial data points near each other are almost never `independent`, violating the common assumption that they are (a/k/a `spatial autocorrelation`)

## Special problems in spatial data

<br>

Ecological properties

-   Low 'ecological resolution'

-   High 'data resolution'

-   Complex relationships

(next slide shows **Soil moisture**, **Veg reflectance**, **Yield**...)

knitr::include_graphics("img/fig02.png")

## Cressie's classification

<br>

1)  **Geostatistical data** x-y point data with a continuous measure (like soil moisture). Extrapolation between measured points is a goal.

2)  **Areal data** points or polygons representing a uniform unit of measure (like the crop planted within a field boundary)

3)  **Point pattern data** what is the spatial pattern (like whether pest outbreaks are random or spatially explained by some feature)

## Geostatistical versus Areal

<center>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics("img/fig03.png")
```

</center>

## Components of spatial data

<br>

1)  Spatial component (x-y)

2)  Attribute component (something measured or classified)

3)  Scale and sample size (for measuring earthworms, is 1m or 1000m better to sample?)

4)  **Vectore data** versus **Raster data**

## Datasets

Ex: dataset 1 yellow billed cuckoo habitat

What spatial featured are associated with presence in this species?
