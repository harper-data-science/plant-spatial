This is meant for beginners, but...

## R and book setup

<br>

- Code editors (most use RStudio)

- The data (links on the Harper Data Science page)

- Libraries needed

- Chapter scripts

(Be aware of {sp} versus {sf})


## R 'Basics'

<br>

- Syntax

- Data types

- Functions

- Packages

- Programming concepts, like loops

(similar content to module 1 of the R Stats Bootcamp, but MORE CONDENSED)



## Handling data in R (including geospatial)

<br>

- Data Frames, lists

- Spatial data structures

(the spatial data objects are complex)

- Coordinate reference system concept

- Spatial polygons, etc.



## Aspects of graphics

<br>

- `Plot()`, `ggplot()`, `{lattice}`

- The examples are fairly advanced!
